            Greater Seattle Volleyball Officials (GSVO) is committed to providing qualified volleyball officials for member schools of the Washington Interscholastic Athletic Association (WIAA), non-member schools, and recreation programs in the Puget Sound area.

            <br><br>The purpose of GSVO is to further the interest of volleyball by providing a process for recruiting, training, and retaining referees to officiate middle school through high school levels. We provide officials for volleyball competition in accordance with the rules of the National Federation of High Schools (NFHS).

            <br><br>We hope your being here means you have a passion for volleyball and an interest in becoming an official!

            <br><br>GSVO offers training once a year, in the summer before the start of the fall volleyball season. Training includes classroom sessions, on-court instruction, and one-on-one mentoring. We also offer a system of growth and advancement to assist each person in succeeding at whatever level one aspires to officiate.

            <br><br>Officiating is a great way to meet new people, develop relationships, have fun, make some money, and continue in the sport.

            <br><br>We encourage you to contact us with your interest and look forward to working with you as an official with GSVO.
